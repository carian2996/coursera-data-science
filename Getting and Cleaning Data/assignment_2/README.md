First, and very important, set your working directory. The run_analysis.R script must download (if doesn't exit the data), unzip the folder and load the data in the working directory.

If the you already download the folder, just rename with "data.zip".

The folder data.zip and the script must be in your working directory in order to the script works properly...

	- Run the script in R. (You should use the source function)
	- The you will be created two files. "merged_data.txt" and "data_means.txt" in your working directory
