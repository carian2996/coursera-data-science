# John Hopkins University: 

Certification [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/SR5SCBLSE3JR)  
Specialization description [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)  
Data Product: https://carian.shinyapps.io/prediction_word/  

This Specialization covers the **concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline**, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. **In the final Capstone Project, youâ€™ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data**. 

During this specialization I learned: 
- Use R to clean, analyze, and visualize data.
- Navigate the entire data science pipeline from data acquisition to publication.
- Use GitHub to manage data science projects.
- Perform regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models.

The capstone project class allowed me to create a public data product. You can check the work for this capstone project here: https://github.com/carian2996/coursera-prediction-text

Major technologies and techniques used: 
1. R (and RStudio)
2. Github
3. Regression Analysis
